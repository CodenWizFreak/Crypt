## Decentralization
- **Definition**: The process of distributing control away from a central authority.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces single points of failure.
  - Enhances security and resilience.
  - Provides greater transparency and censorship resistance.
- **Examples**:
  - Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on decentralized networks.
  - Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks such as IPFS.

## Consensus Mechanisms
- **Definition**: Protocols used to achieve agreement on the state of a distributed ledger.
- **Types**:
  - **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Miners solve cryptographic puzzles (used in Bitcoin).
  - **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators are chosen based on their stake (used in Ethereum 2.0).
  - **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Users vote for trusted validators.
  - **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**: Nodes reach consensus despite faulty actors.
- **Importance**:
  - Ensures network security and immutability.
  - Prevents double-spending and fraud.

## Cryptography
- **Definition**: Techniques for securing information and communications from adversaries.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Public-Key Cryptography**: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and digital signatures.
  - **Hashing**: Converts data into fixed-size outputs (SHA-256 in Bitcoin).
  - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Allow one party to prove a statement is true without revealing details.
- **Applications in Blockchain**:
  - Securing transactions.
  - Verifying identities and digital signatures.
  - Enabling privacy-enhancing protocols.

## Smart Contracts
- **Definition**: Self-executing contracts with terms directly written in code.
- **Features**:
  - Automated execution when predefined conditions are met.
  - Immutable once deployed.
  - Trustless interactions without intermediaries.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
  - Token issuance (ERC-20, ERC-721 for NFTs).
  - Supply chain management and digital agreements.
